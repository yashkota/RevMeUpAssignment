Ques: UI Coding Problem: Deck of Cards
Problem Statement
Build a UI in HTML/CSS/JS to draw random cards from a deck of cards on click of a button.
- There is a deck of 52 cards, of 4 different suits.
- Draw 5 cards at random from this deck on click of a button.
- Once a card has been drawn, it’s removed from the deck and shouldn’t appear twice.
- Repeatedly clicking the button should keep drawing cards until the deck is over.
- Render all drawn cards in the UI.
You can demonstrate by creating a codepen or sending the code over email.
Coding Expectations
- Demonstrable code is a must!
- You can use any library/framework of your choice. Feel free to Google if required.
- Handle edge cases correctly.
- Extra points for responsiveness, good looking UI and animations. Layout should be
decent on either desktop or mobile.
- Code should be simple, clean and professional. Handle modularity where applicable.
- Use of ES6 and modern frontend constructs is encouraged.
- Think performance as well.
